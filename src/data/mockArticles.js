        publishedISO: estimateISOString('6 hrs ago'),
        fullContent: `<p>The victory-party din for Mark Carney and his Liberal Party had only just faded when Donald Trump chimed in with a less than ringing endorsement of the winners.</p>
<p>"It was the one that hated Trump, I think, the least that won," the US president said on Wednesday of Carney, whose party had just retained power by winning a near outright majority of the seats in Canada's general election.</p>
<p>The Canadian prime minister may accept being the lesser of two evils in Trump's mind, however. The US president also said that he thinks the former Bank of England governor "couldn't have been nicer" in the first post-election phone conversation.</p>
<p>The two men are expected to meet at the White House sometime within the next week.</p>
<p>For Trump, politics is often personal. The president's affinity for Vladimir Putin colours US relations with Russia, for instance. His respect for Xi Jinping has kept US-China relations on a relatively even keel even as the two nations are engaging in an extended trade war.</p>
<p>Canada, on the other hand, has spent an extended time on the other end of this equation. Trump's distaste for former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was palpable practically from the US president's first day in office in 2017.</p>
<p>The two leaders did not see eye to eye in Trump's first term - then things got worse. Their lengthy, aggressive handshake during their first in-person visit just a few weeks after Trump's inauguration foreshadowed what would be a long and trying relationship.</p>
<p>It was punctuated by passive-aggressive jabs, snide comments and, upon Trump's return to the White House, the president's derisive reference to "Governor Trudeau" and repeated talk of turning Canada into America's "cherished 51st state".</p>
<p>Trump's annexation talk continued even after Trudeau was replaced by Carney, but the temperature has seemed to drop somewhat, as the smooth international banker with a Harvard and Oxford pedigree replaced the younger, boyishly good looking Trudeau.</p>
<p>Trump, while he likes to rail against global elites, is drawn to Ivy League backgrounds and accumulated wealth, which Carney has in spades. And Carney has another attribute Trump tends to value - he's now a winner.</p>
<p>Even if he owes some of his victory to Trump's (negative) influence, the Liberal leader did engineer a remarkable reversal of fortune for his party when the outlook appeared gloomy just a few months before.</p>
<p>Carney and Trump are still a study in contrasts, something that presents risk for the former as their first meeting looms. The Canadian is measured, controlled and organised. Trump is impulsive and unpredictable. Both can be impatient at times, with little tolerance for the trivialities of modern politics.</p>
<p>There were reports that Trump brought up annexation during his first conversation with Carney after he became prime minister, but the Canadian leader kept that to himself and word only leaked weeks later - a characteristically cool response that may offer a hint of how he will handle Trump's bluster.</p>
<p>Paul Samson, president of the Centre for International Governance Innovation who has held various senior positions in Canadian government over 30 years, has seen Carney in action first-hand.</p>
<p>He tells the BBC that the new Canadian prime minister will likely use a mix of "economic knowledge, strategy and personal diplomacy" to get on Trump's good side.</p>
<p>"Carney likes to get things done," Mr Samson said. He is also calm, easy going and could connect with Trump on a personal level. "But he certainly does not want to come across as subservient."</p>
<p>If Carney heads into his first full term in office with a somewhat cleaner slate in dealing with the US president, it will still be a precarious situation.</p>
<p>While Canada has won a reprieve from some of the most onerous tariffs Trump initially announced on his nation, the clock is ticking - and striking some kind of settlement with the Americans will be no easy task.</p>
<p>"We will have a partnership on our terms," Carney told the BBC on Tuesday. "I would distinguish between what the president wants and what he expects."</p>
<p>Carney went on to say that Trump's "territorial views" on his country are "never, ever going to happen". It was a familiar message, one he delivered repeatedly on the campaign trail and in his election night victory speech.</p>
<p>"America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country," he said on Monday. "But these are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us."</p>
<p>Carney's rejection of an American takeover of Canada may not be enough to satisfy the US president, however. And it may not be possible for Carney and the Canadians to determine exactly what it is that Trump expects, either.</p>
<p>He has said Canada must do more to limit undocumented migration into the US, which is low, and cross-border fentanyl drug trafficking, which is minimal. He has also inflated the US-Canada trade deficit and said that the nation is "ripping off" America. Given the population disparity between the two nations and Canada's vast natural resources, a balanced trade ledger between the two could be an unreachable ask.</p>
<p>Whatever Trump and the Americans ultimately want, the US, as Canada's largest export market, has considerable power over its northern neighbour should it wish to exercise it. But, as Carney noted in his talk with the BBC, Canada isn't powerless either.</p>
<p>"We are the biggest client for more than 40 states," he said. "We supply them with vital energy, conventional energy and potentially could supply them with critical minerals."</p>
<p>He also said Canada could look to "like-minded countries" for more reliable trading partners, such as the UK or the EU, cutting the US out of the equation.</p>
<p>Doing so, however, would be abandoning a long and reliable partnership with the US, one that had been based on shared ideals as well as shared geography.</p>
<p>Trump's first 100 days back in the White House has called all of that into question, however.</p>
<p>It's a rift that seems unlikely to be fully mended, no matter how well Trump and Carney hit it off when they sit down in person to talk.</p>

        "fullContent": "<p>Germany's Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party has been designated as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution.</p>\
    <p>\"The ethnicity- and ancestry-based understanding of the people prevailing within the party is incompatible with the free democratic order,\" the domestic intelligence agency said in a statement.</p>\
    <p>The German foreign ministry defended the decision after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the move \"tyranny in disguise\" and Vice-President JD Vance said the Berlin Wall was being rebuilt.</p>\
    <p>The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.</p>\
    <p>The parliament, or Bundestag, will hold a vote next week to confirm conservative leader Friedrich Merz as chancellor, heading a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats.</p>\
    <p>AfD joint leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said the decision was \"clearly politically motivated\" and a \"severe blow to German democracy\". They argued their party was being \"discredited and criminalised\" shortly before the change of government.</p>\
    <p>The far-right AfD had already been placed under observation for suspected extremism in Germany, and the intelligence agency had also classed it as right-wing extremist in three states in the east, where its popularity is highest.</p>\
    <p>The agency, or Verfassungsschutz, said specifically that the AfD did not consider citizens of a \"migration background from predominantly Muslim countries\" as equal members of the German people.</p>\
    <p>AfD deputy chairman Stephan Brandner said the decision was \"complete nonsense, has absolutely nothing to do with law and order\".</p>\
    <p>However, acting Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the agency had made a clear and unambiguous decision with \"no political influence whatsoever\", after a comprehensive review and a report of 1,100 pages.</p>\
    <p>Bundestag Vice-President Andrea Lindholz said that as a designated right-wing extremist group the AfD should not be treated as other parties, especially in parliament.</p>\
    <p>Because of their large number of seats, AfD members could be eligible to chair parliamentary committees, but Lindholz said that idea was now \"almost unthinkable\".</p>\
    <p>After their election success, AfD leaders said the so-called firewall that had prevented other parties from working with them should end.</p>\
    <p>\"Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them,\" said Tino Chrupalla.</p>\
    <p>Having doubled its share of the vote in under four years, Chrupalla's party is still second in the opinion polls behind Merz's conservatives, despite several scandals, including one high-profile member being convicted of using banned Nazi slogans.</p>\
    <p>Earlier this year Alice Weidel embraced the term \"remigration\", widely seen as meaning the mass deportation of people with a migrant background, although she rejected that definition.</p>\
    <p>The AfD also attracted the support of leading figures in the Trump administration. Nine days before the election, US Vice-President JD Vance met Weidel in Munich and said there was no place for \"firewalls\", alleging that free speech was in retreat in Europe.</p>\
    <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk gave Weidel a long audience in a livestreamed chat on X and called on Germans to vote for the AfD. He then repeatedly posted his support for Weidel's party in the run-up to the election.</p>\
    <p>On Friday JD Vance posted on X that \"the AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it.\"</p>\
    <p>He also accused the \"German establishment\" of rebuilding the Berlin Wall - a reference to the barrier built in 1961 to separate East and West Berlin during the Cold War.</p>\
    <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision taken by the German intelligence agency meant it had been given \"new powers to surveil the opposition. That's not democracy - it's tyranny in disguise\".</p>\
    <p>This prompted a rare retort from the German Foreign Office.</p>\
    <p>\"This is democracy,\" it posted on X. \"We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.\"</p>\
    <p>Map shows support for AfD in eastern Germany</p>\
    <p>As part of its role in ensuring Germany's \"free democratic basic order\", the domestic intelligence agency is responsible for both counter-intelligence and investigating terror threats.</p>\
    <p>Although its change in designation of the AfD is expected to be challenged in the courts, it would likely lower the threshold for the agency using informants and surveillance in monitoring the party.</p>\
    <p>Some German politicians have said the party's new designation should lead to a ban.</p>\
    <p>Under Germany's Basic Law - a constitution adopted in 1949 four years after the fall of Hitler's Nazi regime - parties that \"deliberately undermine the functioning of Germany's free democratic basic order\" can be banned if they act in a \"militant and aggressive way\".</p>\
    <p>Domestic intelligence cannot push for a ban on the party - that can only go through the two houses of parliament, government or the constitutional court - but its latest decision could encourage others to start the process.</p>\
    <p>Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned against rushing into a decision, but Heidi Reichinnek of the Left Party said no-one could accept that \"a proven right-wing extremist party is fighting and destroying our democracy from within\".</p>\
    <p>Since the war, the constitutional court has banned only two parties, both in the 1950s.</p>\
    <p>The Christian Democrat state premier of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany called on the incoming government to initiate proceedings to ban the AfD. Daniel GÃ¼nther told Spiegel magazine that the party presented a risk to \"social harmony\".</p>\
    <p>But Michael Kretschmer, the Christian Democrat premier in the eastern state of Saxony, was quoted as saying that the \"enemies of democracy are not fought solely by the state - defence of democracy begins in the heart of society\".</p>\
    <p>In a further post on X, Musk argued on Friday that banning \"the centrist AfD\", which he also labelled Germany's most popular party, \"would be an extreme attack on democracy\".</p>\
    <p>The deputy leader of the Social Democrat SPD, Serpil Midyatli, said it was now in black and white what everybody already knew. \"It's clear for me that the ban has to come,\" she said, according to German press agency dpa.</p>\
    <p>Regardless of the AfD's election success, she said the founding fathers of Germany's post-war constitution had sought to ensure the country would not be plunged back into the abyss.</p>",
